                    <li>3 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced </li>

            <h2>Method</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Make the focaccia dough</li>
                In a medium-sized mixing bowl, or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix together all the dough ingredients until the flour is fully absorbed. You don't need to actually knead the dough, though I sometimes knead it a few times in the bowl when mixing by hand to incorporate the last of the flour...
